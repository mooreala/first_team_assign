This is the beginning of our story..

Rammstein decided to go on tour.
So I got in my porche and went to get tickets.
I first stopped by the Backerei for some Apfelkuchen.
Then I headed to the wettbewerbsfaehig Apfelkuchen eating contest. I won!
I did not feel weel afterwards as each Apfelkuchen tasted like Bratwurst in Lederhose.
I decided to take a nap at the Biergarten, but I woke up in a new BMW.
To my surprise Dr. Mehlhase was in the passenger seat eating Gebaeck.
So I suddenly poured Klimmanlage into my hair and started barking like a Hund.
And Dr. Mehlhase found that so amusing that she gave my team and I a perfect grade. Then I we had Daener.
